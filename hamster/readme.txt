Hamster 2.0

Intro

Hamster is tool or "sidejacking". It acts as a proxy server that
replaces your cookies with session cookies stolen from somebody
else, allowing you to hijack their sessions.

Cookies are sniffed using the Ferret program. You need a copy of
that as well.


Building

The projects/makefiles are in the "hamster/build" directory. For Linux, 
you probably want the "hamster/build/gcc4" directory.

Building is pretty straightforward. If you want to make your own project, 
you can simply compile all the files together. Any errors that occur 
should be obvious how to fix.


Changes

I'm currently rearranging how the code works, things might be in odd
places at the moment.
